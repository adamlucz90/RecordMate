# RecordMate

My first crack at putting together a web-based Javascript app.

Recordmate allows users to search for records based on album title or song title.  From there they are returned information about the record including youtube samples and ebay auction results.  Users can also register for an account where they can store a wishlist of records they intend to purchase and keep a digital account of their own collection.

This php based version is currently abandoned as an Angular version is under constrution.
